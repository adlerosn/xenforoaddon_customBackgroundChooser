# Background Chooser
#### xenforoaddon_customBackgroundChooser

### Abandon Date

### Scenario

In a forum, each theme and forum category had a fixed set of backgrounds selected by the administrator. Users wanted being able to set their background.

### Solution

An add-on that allows users changing their backgrounds.

### Conflicts

Some caching add-ons may improperly cache data from this add-on and apply a custom background to all users.
